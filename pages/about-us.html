            <h1> About US </h1>
            <p>Virya Paramita Energy (VPE) Private Limited is a pioneering renewable wave-energy company in India aiming to
                help safely and responsibly meet the country’s growing needs for energy by generating electricity from
                waves. VPE endeavors to bring in an efficient class of indigenous wave energy converters (WECs) to market,
                enabling cost-effective low and no-carbon solutions to climate change. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
                is the creed that underpins VPE’s bespoke initiatives in creating a self-reliant and self-generating energy
                system in India. The company’s initial goal is to harvest 1 GW power from the enormously large wave
                potential of the Indian coast, diversifying the country's total energy production scenario. VPE is a torch
                bearer in promoting the use of wave energy sources and will be the beacon in disseminating the ‘Blue
                Economy’ in India.
